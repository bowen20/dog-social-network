# dog-social-network
This app is a website I built on my own that allows dog owners to publish information about their dogs and to view information about other dogs.

The webpages are written in HTML with embedded JavaScript. The database is using MySQL. The server side script is written in NodeJS. Some of the features on the webpages are implemented with JavaScript. When the NodeJS server side code starts, it first generates the homepage. This is output to the browser and based on the user's actions different HTTP requests with different words like GET or PUT the server side code will then invoke different methods. For example the user is trying to create a new profile. They need to use the PUT command to input the dog's name and to upload a picture of the dog. The method used is register which puts the information into the database. Another example is the user is trying to view a profile. The HTTP request is GET. Based on that the server side will retrieve the data from the database and invoke the buildProfile method to build the HTML of the dog's profile.

The HTML code created by the server side also has embedded JavaScript code for enhanced presentation purposes. The PHP was used to retrieve data from and insert data into the database. JavaScript was used to call the Google Maps and weather.com API. The JavaScript was used to implement a slider with images on the browser.
